# Bayesian_Statistics_Project_2019
This is part of a project in Bayesian Statistics at Politecnico di Milano fall of 2019. Here you will find the main code and data that is used for our analysis and a PDF summarizing the entire work.

The project is based on two steps, first clustering and then survival analysis. To make it easier the workspaces for the MCMC's done are saved in "./MCMC_output" and can be loaded into corresponding R-script to verify mixing or other results.

The data is originally from the PRO-ACT database, an amazing open resource for the ALS disease. Further we would like to acknowledge that much of the code is based on R, JAGS or BUGS code from class.
